Installing Zammad

We first will install the required tools:

$ sudo apt install curl apt-transport-https gnupg

This is assuming we've installed Elasticsearch, it isn't a hard dependency so we can skip it but if you run into an issue, please install.

We'll also have to ensure the correct locale to allowed Zammad to work correctly
